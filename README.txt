In one of the OOP based languages, make a program where it is possible:
   * User can enter, view or edit information about any of the PC parts. Each part has three attributes - type, model and price. 
   When entering or editing information, _all_ attributes have to be filled in with information. Examples of PC parts are given in the table.
   Each attribute's value, ex. "Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB" or "RAM" has to be kept _separately_. (ex. it is not allowed to have "RAM Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB" as one value.)

   * Programm control is happening using GUI.

   * Information about PC parts is possible to be saved in a text file in this format:
   
   -PC Part-
   Type: RAM
   Model: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB
   Price: 99,99 EUR
